### Download

### Git submodule

```
git submodule add https://github.com/gearsdigital/kirby-reporter.git site/plugins/kirby-reporter
```

### Composer

```
composer require gearsdigital/kirby-reporter
```
## Options
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `kirby-reporter.repository` | The repository to which the issues are reported.<br>*Must be a fully qualified url:* `https://github.com/gearsdigital/kirby-reporter`|
| `kirby-reporter.token` | Your personal access token.<br>*Your personal access token is never populated to the client!* |
| `kirby-reporter.disabled` | Setting this option to `true` disables the plugin completely. |

## Configuration

### Customizing the Form

Create a file named `reporter.yml` and save it to `/site/blueprints/reporter/reporter.yml`

The custom blueprint will override the default blueprint excluding the `title` which is, apart from translations, _not_ configurable. It is fully customizable by using [blueprint fields](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/blueprints/fields).

Location: `/site/blueprints/reporter/reporter.yml`

```yml
reporter:
  fields:
    steps:
      label: Steps to reproduce
      type: textarea
      help: Please be as precise as possible.
    type:
      label: Issue Type
      type: select
      options:
        - value: bug
          text: Bug
        - value: feature
          text: Feature
        - value: enhancement
          text: Enhancement
``` 
> It is currently not (and will probably never be) possible to map custom fields to specifc fields of your issue tracker!

#### Default Blueprint

Location: `/site/plugins/kirby-reporter/blueprints/reporter/reporter.yml`

```yml
reporter:
  fields:
    description:
      label: Description
      type: textarea
      help: Please be as precise as possible.
```

### Customizing the Issue Template

Create a file named `reporter.php` and save it to `/site/templates/reporter.php`.

Within the template you have access to an array which contains all submitted fields. Each field consists the `key` and the selected `value`.

```php
/** @var array $fields */
$fields;
```

You can and do whatever you want to customize the output using `php`. However, the generated output is always treated as plain text and used as content of the `description` field of your issue tracker.

>It might make sense to render **markdown** or anything else your issue tracker can deal with.

#### Default Template

Location: `/site/plugins/kirby-reporter/templates/reporter.php`

```php
## Issue Template

<?= $fields['description']; ?>
```

### Personal Access Token

Personal access tokens are substitute passwords for your account to avoid putting your real password into configuration files. It depends on your platform how to obtain a *personal access token* (or *app password*).

For the sake of simplicity I just refer to the related help docs:

- [Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
- [Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
- [Bitbucket Cloud](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/app-passwords-828781300.html)

It is probably a good idea to create a custom user with limited scope access for issue reporting.
